## Experience
 
### Software Intern  
**AndinoLabs (Andino Global Tech Private Limited)** – Bengaluru, Karnataka  
September 2025 – March 2026  
 
**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis, Amazon SQS, Amazon S3, Azure VM  
 
- Built backend services using FastAPI (MVC) following SDLC practices.
- Designed stateless internal APIS for horizontal scaling using a Redis-backed task orchestrator.
- Implemented request validation (Pydantic), rate limiting, and exponential backoff for external API integrations.
- Built asynchronous microservices using Celery, Redis, and Amazon SQS with task status tracking, retries, and failure handlers. Ensured idempotent processing via database status flags and selective fetching of incomplete records.
- Improved LLM response reliability using BM25-based RAG grounding.
- Integrated Amazon S3 for file storage and implemented structured centralized logging.
- Migrated legacy Python application to 'uv dependency management.
