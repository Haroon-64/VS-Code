## Experience

<!-- **Machine Learning Researcher**  
*IUST Awantipora*  
*May ’24 - Present*  

- **Developing** a machine learning model for the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification, establishing a baseline predictive model as a foundation for future enhancements. -->

**Machine Learning Intern**  
*InternzValley*  
*February ’24 - April ‘24*  

- **Successfully Developed and Improved** machine learning models, Preprocessed data, and used data analysis to gain insights:

1. *Heart Disease Classifciation*
- Enhanced model accuracy from 80% to 85%
- Precision increased from 0.78 to 0.85 (No Disease) and 0.82 to 0.86 (Disease)
- Recall boosted from 0.78 to 0.81 (No Disease) and 0.82 to 0.88 (Disease)

2. *Titanic data Analysis*
- Found correlation between ticket class and survival: 63% of 1st class, 48% of 2nd class, and 25% of 3rd class passengers survived
- Gender and survival rates: 73% of females and 20% of males survived
- Age group analysis: Higher survival for ages 0-10, lowest for ages 60-80
