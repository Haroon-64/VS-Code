## Experience

### Software Intern

**AndinoLabs (Andino Global Tech Private Limited)**                                        Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
September 2025 – March 2025

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Amazon SQS, Amazon S3, Azure Foundary, Azure VM

* Built backend services using FastAPI following MVC architecture and SDLC practices.
* Improved response reliability by grounding LLM outputs using a BM25-based RAG retrieval sevice.
* Worked primarily on data handling, query optimization, and ORM-based database interactions using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy.
* Assisted in database schema design and setup.
* Designed microservices with asynchronous task processing using Celery and Amazon SQS.
* Migrated an existing Python application to use uv for dependency management and execution.
